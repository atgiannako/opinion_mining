## Thesis Description

In this thesis we create a method for extracting opinion targets by mixing word embeddings, vocabulary and syntax features. Tools such as SyntaxNet, Stanford Parser and Spacy will be used. Moreover, these features will be combined with word embeddings (e.g. using Google's Word2Vec). 

The resulting feature vectors will be used in a classification task to find opinion aspects (trai classifier with publicly available corpora). The results obtained with each parser will be compared with a baseline model.

This Master thesis is done in the Swisscom Digital Lab in collaboration with the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence at EPFL.
