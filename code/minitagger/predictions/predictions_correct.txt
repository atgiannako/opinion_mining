To O O
be O O
completely O O
fair O O
the O O
only O O
redeeming O O
factor O O
was O O
the O O
food B B
which O O
was O O
above O O
average O O
but O O
could O O
n't O O
make O O
up O O
for O O
all O O
the O O
other O O
deficiencies O O
of O O
Teodora O O

The O O
design B B

very O O
nice O O

in O O
a O O

The O O

two O O
people O O
or O O
two O O
hundred O O

its O O
just O O
the O O
most O O
tender O O

But O O
nothing O O
stands O O
out O O
about O O
the O O
cooking B B

overall O O
a O O
solid O O
restaurant O O
and O O
at O O
less O O
than O O
$ O O
40pp O O
including O O
wine B B
a O O
solid O O

as O O
well O O

Since O O
it O O
literally O O
is O O
a O O
complete O O
hole O O
in O O
the O O
wall O O
it O O
's O O
a O O
bit O O
intimidating O O
at O O
first O O
but O O
you O O
get O O
over O O
that O O
very O O
quickly O O
as O O
soon O O
as O O
the O O
friendly O O
staff B B
welcomes O O
you O O
do O O
n't O O
hesitate O O
to O O
ask O O
for O O
help O O
with O O
what O O
to O O
get O O

The O O
service B B
is O O
ok O O
some O O
of O O
the O O
people O O
did O O
n't O O
get O O
what O O
they O O
asked O O
for O O

You O O
order O O
from O O
a O O
menu B B
so O O
you O O
leave O O
feeling O O
like O O
you O O
missed O O
the O O
full O O
experience O O

We O O
have O O
never O O
had O O
any O O
problems O O
with O O
charging O O
the O O
meal B B
or O O
the O O
tip B B
and O O
the O O
food B B
was O O
delivered O O
quickly O O
but O O
we O O
live O O
only O O
a O O
few O O
minutes O O
walk O O
from O O
them O O

They O O
are O O
tasty O O
but O O
I O O
suggest O O
only O O
eating O O
one O O
with O O
meat B B
because O O
they O O
tend O O
not O O
to O O
mesh O O
that O O
well O O
with O O
the O O
average O O
American O O
digestive O O
system O O

Try O O
the O O
hot B B
dogs I I
too O O
they O O
're O O
snappy O O
and O O
delicious O O

The O O

delicious O O
and O O
beautifully O O
prepared O O
along O O
with O O
the O O

and O O
personable O O
service B B

Would O O
n't O O
recomend O O
it O O
for O O
dinner B B

While O O
they O O
keep O O
the O O
capex B B
to O O
a O O
minimum O O
they O O
do O O
put O O
some O O
cash O O
into O O
the O O
bagels B B
because O O
they O O
among O O
the O O
best O O
in O O
the O O
city O O

Have O O
frequented O O
ino O O
for O O
several O O
years O O
and O O
the O O
food B B
remains O O
excellent O O

We O O
laughed O O
when O O
he O O
finally O O
offered O O
us O O
a O O
dessert B B
menu I I
and O O
we O O
left O O
a O O
10 O O
percent O O
tip B B
which O O
was O O
generous O O
I O O
feel O O

And O O
the O O
prices B B
were O O
way O O
to O O
high O O
for O O
what O O
you O O
get O O

While O O
the O O
food B B
was O O
excellent O O
it O O
was O O
n't O O
cheap O O
though O O
not O O
extremely O O
expensive O O
either O O

I O O
have O O
never O O
better O O
enjoyed O O
humble O O
root B B
vegetables I I
or O O
a O O
mushroom B B
consomme I I
and O O
this O O
chef B B
accomplishes O O
without O O
fats O O

The O O
pizza B B
was O O
delivered O O
cold O O
and O O
the O O
cheese B B
was O O
n't O O
even O O
fully O O
melted O O

For O O
the O O
price B B
you O O
can O O
not O O
eat O O
this O O
well O O
in O O
Manhattan O O

The O O
pickles B B
were O O
great O O
addition O O

Any O O
if O O
you O O
have O O
a O O
reservation B B
you O O
'll O O
wait O O
for O O
max O O
5 O O
minutes O O
so O O
have O O
a O O
drink B B
at O O
the O O
bar B B

they O O
did O O
n't O O
disappoint O O
service B B
from O O
the O O
second O O
i O O
arrived O O
at O O
the O O
door O O
was O O
extremely O O
pleasant O O
and O O
attentive O O
with O O
almost O O
one O O
server B B
per O O
table B B

I O O
do O O
n't O O
know O O
who O O
they O O
think O O
they O O
are O O
but O O
they O O
have O O
no O O
respect O O
for O O
the O O
residents O O
of O O
the O O
neighborhood O O
ever O O
since O O
they O O
opened O O
their O O
cabaret O O
next O O
door O O
and O O
blasts O O
loud O O
music B B
till O O
three O O
in O O
the O O
morning O O
every O O
weekend O O
during O O
the O O
summer O O

The O O
only O O
positive O O
was O O
the O O
wait B B
staff I I
which O O
was O O
prompt O O
knowledgable O O
and O O
likeable O O

Hopefully O O
next O O
time O O
I O O
will O O
save O O
room O O
for O O
dessert B B

The O O
service B B
is O O
spotty O O
sometimes O O
really O O
friendly O O
and O O
sometimes O O
barely O O
there O O

Decor B B
is O O
minimalist O O
and O O
clean O O
nothing O O
to O O
distract O O
or O O
commend O O

This O O
place B B
is O O
incredibly O O
tiny O O

In O O
reality O O
to O O
maximize O O
potential O O
diners B B
they O O
were O O
still O O
taking O O
phone O O
reservations B B
and O O
reallocating O O
tables B B
of O O
those O O
waiting B B
in O O
the O O
lobby B B

Not O O
a O O
small O O
feat O O
for O O
good O O
french B B
food I I
in O O
the O O
area O O

The O O
entree B B
was O O
bland O O
and O O
small O O
dessert B B
was O O
not O O
inspired O O

Pizza B B
was O O
a O O
little O O
soggy O O

The O O
wine B B
list I I
is O O
interesting O O
and O O
has O O
many O O
good O O
values O O

By O O
far O O
the O O
best O O
pizza B B
in O O
Manhattan O O

Worse O O
of O O
all O O
$ O O
60 O O
was O O
erroneously O O
added O O
to O O
our O O
$ O O
80 O O
bill B B

But O O
they O O
do O O
n't O O
have O O
a O O
toaster B B
which O O
is O O
strange O O

I O O
have O O
to O O
say O O
I O O
have O O
never O O
had O O
a O O
disapointing O O
meal B B
here O O

The O O
food B B
was O O
well O O
prepared O O
and O O
the O O
service B B
impecable O O

While O O
the O O
food B B
was O O
good O O
certainly O O
no O O
Il O O
Mulino O O
the O O
service B B
was O O
horrendous O O

The O O
food B B
was O O
absolutely O O
amazing O O

All O O
of O O
the O O
pizzas B B
are O O
terrific O O
and O O
the O O
price B B
is O O
even O O
better O O

The O O
menu B B
is O O
nothing O O
like O O
the O O
one O O
on O O
the O O
website O O

We O O
walked O O
in O O
on O O
a O O
Wednesday O O
night O O
and O O
were O O
seated B B
promptly O O

The O O
flavors B B
are O O
great O O
and O O
the O O
menu B B
is O O
extensive O O

The O O
food B B
was O O
amazing O O
the O O
service B B
was O O
so O O
attentive O O
and O O
personable O O
and O O
how O O
about O O
that O O
ambience B B

The O O
food B B
has O O
been O O
consistant O O
for O O
years O O
and O O
it O O
never O O
lets O O
you O O
down O O

And O O
forget O O
what O O
you O O
read O O
under O O
me O O
the O O
atmosphere B B
is O O
n't O O
that O O
bad O O
either O O

One O O
would O O
think O O
we O O
'd O O
get O O
an O O
apology O O
or O O
complimentary O O
drinks B B
instead O O
we O O
got O O
a O O
snobby O O
waiter B B
would O O
n't O O
even O O
take O O
our O O
order O O
for O O
15 O O
minutes O O
and O O
gave O O
us O O
lip O O
when O O
we O O
asked O O
him O O
to O O
do O O
so O O

The O O
lunch B B
special I I
is O O
an O O
asbolute O O
steal O O

While O O
I O O
quite O O
liked O O
the O O
food B B
and O O
the O O
ambience B B
I O O
m O O
not O O
quite O O
sure O O
if O O
it O O
they O O
really O O
deserve O O
it O O
the O O
Michelin O O
rating O O
they O O
have O O
displayed O O
so O O
prooudly O O
in O O
the O O
window O O

The O O

the O O

was O O
pathetic O O
there O O

no O O
ambience B B
at O O
all O O

The O O
miso B B
soup I I
lacked O O
flavor B B
and O O
the O O

was O O
unfortunately O O
not O O

well O O
prepared O O
as O O
in O O
the O O
past O O

While O O
the O O
prices B B

nothing O O

The O O
first O O
2 O O

too O O
rich O O
for O O
me O O
and O O
the O O
dessert B B
wine I I
far O O
too O O
sweet O O

The O O
staff B B
has O O
always O O

a O O
couple O O
of O O
occasions O O

The O O

nice O O

For O O
those O O
prices B B

you O O
expect O O
more O O
and O O
should O O

was O O
pretty O O
tradional O O
but O O
it O O

You O O

really O O
a O O
special O O
bagel B B
experience O O

The O O

a O O
very O O

Edible O O
but O O
really O O
a O O
ripoff O O
at O O
those O O

The O O

downside O O
if O O

ordering O O
in O O
the O O

guys I I
have O O
MAJOR O O
attitude O O

The O O

was O O
so O O
fun O O
and O O
the O O
prices B B
were O O
great O O
on O O
top O O
of O O
the O O
fact O O
that O O
the O O

I O O
have O O
been O O
about O O
4 O O

meal B B

Volare O O
virgins O O
or O O
weekly O O

everyone O O

the O O
same O O
and O O
you O O
ca O O
n't O O
ask O O
for O O
more O O
than O O
that O O
when O O
the O O
service B B
is O O
this O O
friendly O O

Very O O
good O O
wine B B
choices I I

Just O O
because O O
it O O
's O O
cheap O O
does O O
NOT O O
mean O O
the O O
portions B B
are O O
small O O
or O O
the O O
food B B
is O O
nasty O O
IT O O
IS O O
GREAT O O

The O O
pizza B B
was O O
great O O

however O O
it O O
's O O
the O O
service B B
that O O
leaves O O
a O O
bad O O
taste O O
in O O
my O O
mouth O O

They O O
need O O
a O O
kick O O
out O O
of O O
it O O
but O O
until O O
then O O
the O O
sushi B B
is O O
pretty O O
good O O
and O O
the O O
place B B
is O O
consistent O O

For O O
appetizers B B
I O O
recommend O O
the O O
shrimp B B
fritters I I
and O O
dumplings B B

Such O O
nice O O
people B B
working O O
here O O
but O O
I O O
have O O
to O O
review O O
the O O
food B B

The O O
food B B
and O O
staff B B
always O O
surprise O O
me O O
with O O
the O O
new O O
heights O O
they O O
are O O
taken O O
to O O

Ask O O
for O O
Usha O O
the O O
nicest O O
bartender B B
in O O
manhattan O O

Appetizers B B

somewhere O O
around O O

I O O
grew O O
up O O
on O O
these O O

Food B B
was O O
okay O O
nothing O O
great O O

I O O
had O O
the O O
duck B B
breast I I
special I I
on O O
my O O
last O O
visit O O
and O O
it O O
was O O
incredible O O

The O O
food B B
was O O
well O O
prepared O O
and O O
the O O
service B B
impecable O O

I O O
like O O
the O O
somosas B B
chai B B
and O O
the O O
chole B B
but O O
the O O
dhosas B B
and O O
dhal B B
were O O
kinda O O
dissapointing O O

The O O
kitchen B B
however O O
is O O
almost O O
always O O
slow O O

The O O
lava B B
cake I I
dessert I I
was O O
incredible O O
and O O
I O O
recommend O O
it O O

The O O
food B B
was O O
bland O O
oily O O

As O O
always O O
we O O
had O O
a O O
great O O
glass B B
of I I
wine I I
while O O
we O O
waited O O

Make O O
sure O O
you O O
try O O
this O O
place B B
as O O
often O O
as O O
you O O
can O O

I O O
went O O
there O O
for O O
lunch B B
and O O
it O O
was O O
not O O
as O O
good O O
as O O
I O O
expected O O
from O O
the O O
reviews O O
I O O
read O O

The O O

was O O
very O O
patient O O
with O O
us O O
and O O
the O O
food B B
is O O
phenomenal O O

Service B B
was O O
prompt O O
friendly O O
and O O
great O O

There O O
was O O
a O O
small O O
wait B B
but O O
shorter O O
than O O
I O O
expected O O

Wait B B
staff I I
is O O
blantently O O
unappreciative O O
of O O
your O O
business O O
but O O
its O O
the O O
best O O
pie B B
on O O
the O O
UWS O O

The O O
restaurant B B
is O O
cute O O
but O O
not O O
upscale O O

The O O
bagel B B
was O O
huge O O

Other O O
guests O O
enjoyed O O
pizza B B
santa B B
fe I I
chopped I I
salad I I
and O O
fish B B
and I I
chips I I

I O O
highly O O
recommend O O
Cafe O O
St. O O
Bart O O
's O O
for O O
their O O
food B B
the O O
ambience B B
and O O
wonderful O O
service B B

I O O
did O O
n't O O
complain O O
I O O
liked O O
the O O
atmosphere B B
so O O
much O O

Ambience B B
is O O
so O O
cute O O
and O O
quaint O O
good O O
for O O
business O O
although O O
we O O
were O O
there O O
on O O
vacation O O

This O O
is O O
some O O
really O O
good O O
inexpensive O O
sushi B B

And O O
where O O
does O O
Patis B B
go O O
wrong O O
no O O
where O O

My O O
friend O O
got O O
the O O
mushroom B B
pizza I I
which O O
tasted O O
better O O

Kind O O
of O O
a O O
small O O
place B B
but O O
I O O
guess O O
if O O
they O O
are O O
not O O
too O O
busy O O
might O O

cute O O

The O O

very O O
simple O O
but O O
comfortable O O

The O O

small O O
but O O
being O O
that O O
the O O

was O O
so O O
good O O
makes O O
up O O
for O O
that O O

Great O O
Indian B B
food I I
and O O
the O O
service B B
is O O
incredible O O

The O O

I O O
thought O O
the O O
food B B

overated O O
and O O
on O O
the O O
pricey O O
side O O

The O O
only O O
problem O O
is O O

a O O
complete O O
incompetent O O

He O O
offers O O
subpar O O

very O O
relaxed O O

cozy O O
service B B

400.00 O O
where O O
