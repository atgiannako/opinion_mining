To O
be O
completely O
fair O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
which O
was O
above O
average O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O

The O
design B
and O
atmosphere B
is O
just O
as O
good O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B
family I
style I
because O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes B

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B
the O
owner B
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B
is O
fast O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B
decor I
and O
affordable O
city O
prices B

They O
would O
nt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B
of I
wine I
before O
offering O
another O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B
and O
had O
dinner B

Fabulous O
service B
fantastic O
food B
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere B
and O
environment B

I O
grew O
up O
eating O
Dosa B
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
NY O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O

Great O
bagels B
spreads B
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O

The O
service B
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
and O
sometimes O
not O

Had O
we O
been O
stalling O
I O
could O
understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O
from O
but O
we O
had O
been O
there O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
they O
had O
n't O
even O
brought O
us O
a O
check B
yet O

Their O
tuna B
tartar I
appetizer I
is O
to O
die O
for O

I O
love O
Indian B
food I
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O

The O
lava B
cake I
dessert I
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O

good O
selection B
of I
wines I
ranging O
from O
affordable O
to O
high O
end O

The O
entire O
dining B
experience I
was O
wonderful O

The O
wine B
selection I
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
is O
wonderful O
and O
I O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O

Order O
the O
panang B
duck I
it O
's O
fantastic O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B
Salmon I
Sea B
Bass I
and O
Crispy B
Duck I

Service B
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
black O
antique O
seeming O
teapot B
for O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O

service B
is O
friendly O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting B
a I
table I

First O
off O
the O
waitress B
was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
2 O
times O
we O
saw O
her(odd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
6 O
tables B
and O
got O
our O
order O
wrong O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values B
for I
your I
money I

A O
narrow O
corridor B
leads O
to O
a O
tiny O
space B
where O
there O
are O
three O
tiny O
white O
tiled O
counters B
a O
great O
deal O
of O
mess O
stacks O
of O
bottles O
cans O
and O
a O
small O
counter B
holding O
12 O
14 O
entrees B

Okay O
service B

The O
service B
is O
awful O

The O
takeout B
menu I
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded O
menu B
offering O
more O
italian B
dishes I
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess B
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
Five O
minutes O

bottles B
of I
wine I
are O
cheap O
and O
good O

Very O
good O
service B
and O
very O
good O
prices B

The O
service B
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
the O
staff B
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
to O
know O
their O
menu B
present O
your O
meal B
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O

Ess O
A O
Bagel O
either O
by O
Sty O
town O
or O
midtown O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
NY O

Get O
your O
food B
to O
go O
find O
a O
bench O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate B
of I
dumplings I

Please O
try O
the O
Filet B
Mignon I
its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O
piece O
ever O

The O
food B
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
Cantonese B
that O
is O

But O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking B

I O
had O
their O
eggs B
benedict I
for O
brunch B
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B
sauce I
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O

overall O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
$ O
40pp O
including O
wine B
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B
welcomes O
you O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll B
into O
an O
inside O
out O
roll B
but O
the O
roll B
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice B

The O
service B
is O
ok O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O

You O
order O
from O
a O
menu B
so O
you O
leave O
feeling O
like O
you O
missed O
the O
full O
experience O

Very O
popular O
style O
Izakaya O
Sake B
and O
small O
portion B
of O
sake O
friendly O
dishes B

We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
charging O
the O
meal B
or O
the O
tip B
and O
the O
food B
was O
delivered O
quickly O
but O
we O
live O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
walk O
from O
them O

They O
are O
tasty O
but O
I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
American O
digestive O
system O

Try O
the O
hot B
dogs I
too O
they O
're O
snappy O
and O
delicious O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
great O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
laid O
back O
scene O
and O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
afternoon O

Instead O
of O
wasting O
your O
time O
here O
SUPPORT O
RESTAURANTS O
THAT O
CARE O
ABOUT O
FOOD B

We O
ordered O
a O
tuna B
melt I
it O
came O
with O
out O
cheese B
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna B
sandwich I

The O
waiters B
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill B
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O

Do O
n't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you O
're O
starving O
for O
thai B
food I
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O

The O
bill B
is O
approximately O
$ O
25 O
for O
2 O
at O
lunch B
without O
drinks B

The O
overall O
price B
tag I
was O
very O
very O
expensive O
something O
I O
did O
expect O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B
being O
piped O
in O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
is O
worth O
it O

Good O
food B

Prices B
are O
very O
good O

The O
waitress B
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O

The O
place B
is O
larger O
than O
most O
and O
features O
adequate O
seating B
unlike O
most O
joints O
and O
has O
a O
bar B
which O
deserves O
a O
mention O

Threw O
my O
fiance O
's O
surprise O
30th O
birthday O
dinner B
here O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O

May O
the O
owner B
always O
has O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
will O
warmly O
greet O
you O

When O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B
I O
like O
a O
nice O
ambiance B
as O
well O
as O
very O
good O
food B

The O
food B
is O
awesome O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B
bass I

The O
seating B
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O

I O
ordered O
the O
chu B
chu I
curry I
and O
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad B
thai I
chicken I

I O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
outstanding O
particulary O
the O
salmon B
dish I
I O
had O

Moules B
were O
excellent O
lobster B
ravioli I
was O
VERY O
salty O

The O
seafood B
is O
amazing O
there O
's O
a O
good O
wine B
list I
and O
the O
ever O
changing O
menu B
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine B
with O
indian B
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine B
list I
or O
their O
wines B

The O
food B
was O
just O
OK O
at O
least O
for O
what O
food B
was O
available O

The O
ambience B
was O
nice O
but O
service B
was O
n't O
so O
great O

The O
people B
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O

otherwise O
good O
stuff B
for O
late O
nite O
eats B

The O
dinner B
was O
ok O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O

I O
love O
and O
I O
know O
gourmet B
food I
by O
excellence O

I O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment O
of O
bruschetta B
panini O
's O

This O
is O
one O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
pizza B
more O
out O
but O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
take B
out B
pizza I

Our O
server B
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O

And O
really O
large O
portions B

Pair O
you O
food B
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B
on I
tap I
or O
their O
well O
priced B
wine B
list I

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
is O
nt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B
minimun I
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O

The O
place B
is O
a O
little O
tight O
and O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
the O
seating B
by O
the O
entranceway O
can O
be O
pretty O
drafty O

The O
food B
is O
fresh O
delicious O
and O
reasonably O
priced B

The O
bagels B
are O
fabulous O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost B
and O
a O
great O
deal O

We O
ate O
here O
in O
March O
2006 O
and O
ordered O
the O
pre B
theatre B
3-course I
dinner I
with O
wine B
flight I

Probably O
much O
busier O
for O
lunch B
it O
's O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B
too O
close O
to O
downtown O

We O
ve O
only O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
once O
but O
we O
have O
ordered O
many O
times O
for O
dinner B

By O
far O
this O
is O
the O
only O
chinese O
desserts O
place O
I O
know O
in O
NY O
or O
anywhere O
close O
in O
the O
Northeastern O
America O
that O
serves O
desserts B
with I
frog I
jelly I
in O
a O
couple O
of O
varieties O
and O
pig B
feet I
ginger I
simmered I
in I
black I
vinegar I

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host B
Vittorio O
and O
his O
crew B
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
so O
little O
gem O
does O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
so O
frequent O
visitor O

The O
restuarant O
itself O
is O
not O
large O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
several O
round B
tables I
to O
accomodate O
large O
groups O
hoping O
to O
save O
a O
buck O
to O
eat O
authentic O
Taiwanese B

The O
food B
is O
delicious O
from O
the O
specials B
to O
the O
regular B
menu O
fare O
the O
dishes B
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O

For O
all O
of O
you O
new O
to O
Indian B
food I
try O
the O
Paneer B
Roll I
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
heaven O

The O
food B
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates B

The O
food B
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

The O
waitstaff B
were O
attentive O
polite O
and O
helpful O
an O
impressive O
feat O
in O
such O
close O
quarters O

the O
bread B
at O
the O
beginning O
is O
super O
tasty O
and O
makes O
you O
want O
more O
the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
personal O
sizes O
however O
be O
warned O
that O
the O
Peter B
's B
Favourite I
pizza I
with I
prosciutto I
and I
baby I
arugula I
is O
actually O
a O
margarite B
pizza I
with I
cold I
prosciutto I
and I
baby I
arugula I
on I
top I
like O
a O
salad B

if O
this O
happens O
just O
ask O
for O
real O
naan B

My O
goodness O
everything O
from O
the O
fish B
to O
the O
rice B
to O
the O
seaweed B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

The O
dishes B
offered O
were O
unique O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B
sausages I
sardines B
with I
biscuits I
large B
whole I
shrimp I
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B
ice I
cream I
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
ve O
ever O
had O

The O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served B
us O
our O
food B
and O
drinks B
with O
a O
smile O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
they O
have O
outdoor B
seating I
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O

Super O
friendly O
and O
knowledgable O
staff B
fabulous O
bistro B
fare I
and O
a O
wonderful O
jazz B
brunch I
with O
great O
live B
jazz I
the O
chilaquiles B
were O
awesome O

Still O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill B
were O
off O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
your O
own O
measures B
of I
liquers I
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O

The O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place B
look O
wonderful O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food B
art I

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
and O
toppings B
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O

Oh O
do O
n't O
even O
let O
me O
start O
with O
how O
expensive O
the O
bills B
were O

And O
the O
Tom B
Kha I
soup I
was O
pathetic O

Service B
was O
quick O

Been O
going O
here O
since O
it O
opened O
have O
seen O
the O
quality B
value I
decrease O
considerably O

Reasonable O
prices B

Try O
the O
crunchy B
tuna I
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O

No O
refills O
on O
fountain B
drinks I
though O

The O
Steak B
Tartare I
is O
a O
great O
bet O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O

Taj O
Mahal O
offeres O
gret O
value B
and O
great O
food B

They O
even O
have O
a O
section O
in O
the O
menu B
called O
American B
Chinese I
food I

Best O
Italian B
food I
I O
ever O
had O
and O
being O
Italian O
that O
means O
alot O

They O
came O
out O
over O
cooked O
and O
the O
cheese B
was O
almost O
non O
existant O

The O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
prepared O
along O
with O
the O
friendly O
and O
personable O
service B

We O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B
and O
characters B
and O
ar O
food B
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O

Would O
n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner B

My O
husband O
and O
I O
enjoy O
Sangria B

They O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials B
or O
fresh O
ingredients B
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai B

The O
noodle B
and I
rices I
dishes I
taste O
great O

While O
they O
keep O
the O
capex B
to O
a O
minimum O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B

Given O
the O
incredible O
architecture B
surrounding O
it O
this O
place B
has O
no O
character O

Have O
frequented O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B
remains O
excellent O

Try O
the O
spicy B
wontons I
and O
the O
salt B
pepper I
shrimps I

We O
laughed O
when O
he O
finally O
offered O
us O
a O
dessert B
menu I
and O
we O
left O
a O
10 O
percent O
tip B
which O
was O
generous O
I O
feel O

And O
the O
prices B
were O
way O
to O
high O
for O
what O
you O
get O

The O
in B
house B
lady I
DJ I
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music B
and O
moreover O
takes O
requests O

While O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
it O
was O
n't O
cheap O
though O
not O
extremely O
expensive O
either O

Delivery B
service I
is O
great O
too O

They O
pray O
to O
their O
Food O
Gods O
to O
make O
them O
into O
a O
good O
pizza B
like O
VT O
's O

I O
have O
never O
better O
enjoyed O
humble O
root B
vegetables I
or O
a O
mushroom B
consomme I
and O
this O
chef B
accomplishes O
without O
fats O

If O
you O
go O
to O
Roth O
's O
try O
to O
be O
served B
by O
Mike O
he O
is O
GREAT O

The O
pizza B
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B
was O
n't O
even O
fully O
melted O

For O
the O
price B
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin I
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O

The O
pickles B
were O
great O
addition O

Any O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B
you O
'll O
wait O
for O
max O
5 O
minutes O
so O
have O
a O
drink B
at O
the O
bar B

If O
you O
live O
in O
new O
york O
city O
you O
'll O
find O
better O
food B
at O
small O
restaurants O
outside O
of O
time O
square O
and O
spend O
half O
the O
amount B

they O
did O
n't O
disappoint O
service B
from O
the O
second O
i O
arrived O
at O
the O
door O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
and O
attentive O
with O
almost O
one O
server B
per O
table B

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
they O
think O
they O
are O
but O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
ever O
since O
they O
opened O
their O
cabaret O
next O
door O
and O
blasts O
loud O
music B
till O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
every O
weekend O
during O
the O
summer O

The O
rice B
to I
fish I
ration I
was O
also O
good O
they O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice B

The O
only O
positive O
was O
the O
wait B
staff I
which O
was O
prompt O
knowledgable O
and O
likeable O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
this O
low O
key O
upper O
eastsider O
and O
their O
authentically O
thai B
cuisine I

Hopefully O
next O
time O
I O
will O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B

$ O
20 O
for O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
sushi B
can O
not O
be O
beaten O

The O
service B
is O
spotty O
sometimes O
really O
friendly O
and O
sometimes O
barely O
there O

Decor B
is O
minimalist O
and O
clean O
nothing O
to O
distract O
or O
commend O

uni O
from O
maine O
vs O
california O
sea O
vs O
freshwater O
eel B
to O
get O
a O
good O
taste O
comparison O

This O
place B
is O
incredibly O
tiny O

In O
reality O
to O
maximize O
potential O
diners B
they O
were O
still O
taking O
phone O
reservations B
and O
reallocating O
tables B
of O
those O
waiting B
in O
the O
lobby B

I O
ve O
been O
to O
several O
places O
for O
Dim B
Sum I
and O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
WORST O

The O
freshest O
best O
variety B
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B

Made O
my O
dining B
experience I
uncomfortable O

Not O
a O
small O
feat O
for O
good O
french B
food I
in O
the O
area O

The O
entree B
was O
bland O
and O
small O
dessert B
was O
not O
inspired O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B
salad I
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
the O
food B
here O
was O
decent O
not O
great O

The O
Pad B
thai I
lad B
nar I
and O
various O
other O
dishes B
all O
look O
good O
on O
paper O
but O
I O
ve O
had O
better O
thai B
food I
in O
less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places B

Delicious O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price B
but O
do O
not O
go O
here O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
and O
sit O
by O
the O
front B
door I

my O
picks O
Guizhou B
chicken I
fish B
with I
hot I
bean I
source I
fish B
fillet I
in I
spicy I
source I
special B
menu I

Overall O
I O
m O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
its O
Chinatown O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
but O
the O
open B
kitchen I
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O

Pizza B
was O
a O
little O
soggy O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O

By O
far O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
Manhattan O

Worse O
of O
all O
$ O
60 O
was O
erroneously O
added O
to O
our O
$ O
80 O
bill B

But O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
toaster B
which O
is O
strange O

It O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
beef B
version I
had O
cheap O
undercooked O
beef B

Got O
club B
soda I
filled I
with I
ice I
no I
lime I

Oh O
and O
the O
complimentary O
pudding B
dessert I
was O
just O
enough- O
yummy O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks B

It O
saves O
walking O
in O
and O
waiting B
for O
a O
table B
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
crowded O
bar B
at O
dinnertime O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B
here O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink B
too O
because O
they O
have O
100 O
kinds B
of I
beer I

The O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O

BUt O
their O
best O
dish B
is O
thh O
Thai B
spiced I
curry I
noodles I
with I
shrimp I
a O
dish B
that O
would O
cost B
$ O
23.95 O
is O
most O
places O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
16 O
here O

While O
the O
food B
was O
good O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
the O
service B
was O
horrendous O

Great O
pizza B
for O
lunch O
place O

The O
food B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B
food I
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
the O
food B
was O
slightly O
disappointing O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price B
is O
even O
better O

It O
is O
about O
FOOD B
and O
Ambiance B
and O
imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O
will O
be O
it O
we O
only O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
an O
idle O
engine O

The O
menu B
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
one O
on O
the O
website O

We O
walked O
in O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B
promptly O

The O
flavors B
are O
great O
and O
the O
menu B
is O
extensive O

The O
food B
was O
amazing O
the O
service B
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience B

The O
food B
has O
been O
consistant O
for O
years O
and O
it O
never O
lets O
you O
down O

I O
found O
the O
variety O
of O
the O
sashimi B
plate I
to O
be O
satisfying O
fresh O
and O
yummy O

And O
forget O
what O
you O
read O
under O
me O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
n't O
that O
bad O
either O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B
instead O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B
by I
the I
window I

The O
lunch B
special I
is O
an O
asbolute O
steal O

While O
I O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B
and O
the O
ambience B
I O
m O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
Michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O

Service B
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O

being O
a O
fan O
of O
spicy B
ethnic I
foods I
indian O
included O
i O
made O
friends O
with O
this O
place O
long O
ago O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
many O
times O
the O
food B
is O
always O
consistently O
outrageously O
good O

sandwiches B
tho O
pricey O
are O
over O
stuffed O
can O
serve O
2 O
persons O
easily O
thus O
cost O
effective O

Service B
and O
food B
is O
what O
any O
one O
would O
expect O
when O
spending O
that O
type O
of O
money O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B
bar I
and O
has O
great O
staff B

Were O
meeting O
up O
with O
some O
friends O
for O
a O
drink B
at O
Lafayette O
161 O
and O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
Thai O
Angel O
famished O

Great O
sushi B
experience O

My O
steak B
au I
poivre I
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I O
ve O
had O

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiter B
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O

This O
little O
place B
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B
for O
your O
money B

The O
staff B
was O
accomodating O
the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B
is O
lovely O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned B
vegetables I
like O
the O
spinach B
mushroom I
calzone I

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food B

Great O
atmoshere B
and O
worth O
every O
bit O

Great O
vibe B
lots O
of O
people O

And O
the O
staff B
is O
also O
young O
energeic O
and O
hot O

However O
I O
was O
there O
for O
a O
work O
dinner B
not O
long O
ago O
when O
my O
colleague O
from O
London O
noticed O
a O
very O
large O
waterbug O
on O
the O
ceiling B

My O
chow B
fun I
and I
chow I
see I
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O

They O
charge O
different O
prices B
all O
the O
time O

The O
service B
was O
ok O

The O
ingredients B
taste O
fresher O
the O
crust B
is O
thinner O
and O
crispier O
the O
slice B
is O
less O
oily O
and O
it O
's O
never O
burnt O
like O
it O
occasionally O
is O
at O
Joe O
's O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
and O
I O
m O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B
cheeses I
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B
are O
great O

The O
food B
was O
authentic O

I O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish B
of O
spinach B
ravioli I
in I
a I
light I
oil I
and I
garlic I
sauce I
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
NYC O
Italian O
joints O
I O
ve O
tried O
similar O
dishes B
at O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi B
favorites O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner B
and O
drinks B

I O
particularly O
love O
their O
yellowfun B
tuna I
and O
their O
mussel B
selection I

We O
made O
early O
dinner B
reservations I
and O
were O
thoroughly O
impressed O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
grandfather O
its O
old O
school O
Italian O
scenery B
with O
lots O
of O
fun O
stuff O
to O
admire O

Cheese B
plate I
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O

I O
could O
have O
drank O
4 O
glasses B
of I
water I
and O
still O
been O
parched O
so O
watch O
out O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B
are O
very O
attentive O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O

But O
they O
ve O
done O
a O
really O
nice O
job O
of O
offering O
all O
the O
typical O
pizzeria O
faves O
plus O
some O
terrific O
specials B
like O
the O
Godmother B
pizza I
a I
sort I
of I
traditional I
flat I
pizza I
with I
an I
olive I
oil I
brushed I
crust I
and I
less I
tomato I
sauce I
than I
usual O

Will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
try O
the O
chocolate B

The O
food B
was O
below O
average O
the O
service B
was O
pathetic O
there O
was O
no O
ambience B
at O
all O

The O
miso B
soup I
lacked O
flavor B
and O
the O
fish B
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O

While O
the O
prices B
are O
nothing O
special O
the O
portions B
are O
huge O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
fine O
Indian B
dining I
experience I
that O
is O
definitely O
a O
value O
for O
your O
dollar O

And O
even O
with O
it O
's O
Pub B
atmosphere I
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O

Some O
of O
the O
workers B
ignore O
me O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
female O
customers O
other O
times O
they O
ve O
skipped O
my O
order B

The O
specials B
are O
usually O
quite O
good O
too O

Try O
the O
chocolate B
mud I
cake I
warmed I
with O
2 O
scoops O
of O
dulce B
de I
leche I
gelato I

Three O
of O
us O
arrived O
for O
dinner B
about O
5:30 O
on O
a O
week O
night O
without O
reservations B

There O
is O
usually O
a O
wait B
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B
of I
wine I
while O
we O
waited O

Food B
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O

The O
food B
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Heartland O
Breweries O
in O
the O
city O

Not O
the O
greatest O
sushi B
place I
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
$ O
19.95 O
all O
you O
can O
eat O

The O
Thai B
ice I
tea I
was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O

Drinks B
way O
over O
priced B

My O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un O
tasty O
food B
although O
presented O
well O

Waiters B
are O
slow O
but O
sweet O

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B
once O
for O
brunch B
and O
twice O
for O
lunch B

Also O
the O
hostess B
called O
me O
today O
to O
thank O
us O
for O
coming O
and O
mentioned O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
my O
girlfriend O
enjoyed O
her O
birthday O
unexpected O
but O
a O
truly O
above O
and O
beyond O
thing O
to O
do O

people B
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
it O
's O
new O
york O

The O
plain B
slice I
is O
great O
and O
if O
you O
get O
toppings B
the O
whole O
slice O
is O
topped O
with O
them O
not O
sparsely O
sprinkled O
on O
like O
some O
places O

For O
the O
quality B
of I
food I
a O
little O
too O
expensive O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B
jazz I
band I
and O
atmosphere B
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B
Cobb I
Salad I

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B
room I
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O

What O
an O
amazing O
meal B
and O
experience O

The O
wait B
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim B
sum I
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables B
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B
sum I
atmosphere I
is O
not O
your O
gig O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
for O
Chinatown O
alternative O

This O
place O
has O
good O
potential O
but O
needs O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O
spending O
that O
much O
money B
on O
indian B
food I
you O
can O
get O
everywhere O
else O

As O
I O
made O
the O
title O
it O
's O
an O
affordable O
restaurant O
for O
great O
taste B

Yes O
there O
might O
be O
a O
wait B
if O
you O
have O
no O
reservations B

Downstairs B
lounge I
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

The O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
the O
sauces B
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O

Everything O
looks O
great O
the O
drinks B
the O
decor B
the O
food B
even O
the O
people O

The O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
coat B
check I
girls I
who O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
know O
what O
a O
customer O
is O
on O
a O
realtively O
non O
busy O
night O
for O
the O
coat B
check I
girls I

The O
food B
is O
wonderful O
tasty O
and O
filling O
and O
the O
service B
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B
casserole I
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken B
all O
dark O
meat B
and O
on O
the O
bone O

I O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B
here O
and O
it O
's O
always O
been O
perfect O
on O
a O
date O
with O
my O
husband O
with O
my O
mom O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
larger O
groups O

Delicate O
spices B
onions B
eggs B
and O
a O
kick O
ass O
roti B

My O
wife O
and O
I O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi B
and O
one O
secondi B
and O
split O
them O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B
and O
the O
great O
staff B
at O
La O
Lanterna O

It O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
Sichuan B
chef I
who O
started O
the O
chain O
in O
Chinatown O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B

Best O
Pastrami B
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B
without O
being O
ridiculous O

The O
first O
2 O
courses B
were O
very O
good O
but O
the O
chocolate B
sampler I
was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B
wine I
far O
too O
sweet O

The O
staff B
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
and O
the O
chef B
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O

Quality O
ingredients B
preparation O
all O
around O
and O
a O
very O
fair O
price B
for O
NYC O

My O
entree B
of O
hot B
pot I
with I
seafood I
was O
full O
of O
imitation O
crabmeat B
with O
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
shrimp B
and O
squid B
and O
was O
unnecessarily O
heated O
with O
a O
burner O

The O
pizza B
was O
really O
good O

Food B
is O
average O
and O
I O
would O
say O
even O
the O
chain O
restaurant O
Baluchi O
's O
tastes O
better O

The O
place B
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B
is O
fantastic O

The O
food B
there O
is O
so O
good O
that O
even O
to O
order O
out O
the O
wait B
is O
incredible O

If O
anyones O
has O
doubt O
of O
not O
knowing O
enough O
about O
wines O
please O
check O
their O
wine B
list I

Have O
the O
iced B
tea I

Small O
servings B
for O
main O
entree B
i O
had O
salmon B
was O
nt O
impressed O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B
it O
was O
good O

Obv B
caviar I
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B
is O
so O
diverse O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
taste O
so O
manydifferent O
varietys O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
NY O
maybe O
anywhere O

The O
spicy O
Tuna B
roll I
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price B
range I

The O
place B
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
simple O
dishes B
and O
wine B
served B
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B

Overall O
the O
ingredients B
and O
technique B
are O
there O
and O
I O
am O
encouraged O
enough O
to O
return O
at O
lunch B
or O
dinner B
to O
see O
whether O
the O
boldness O
of O
the O
flavour O
palette O
improves O

The O
fish B
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
also O
really O
nice O

Service B
was O
devine O
oysters B
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
and O
the O
price B
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O

Ballato O
's O
is O
consistently O
delicious O
authentic O
italian B
food I

For O
those O
prices B
and O
the O
dressed O
up O
atmosphere B
you O
expect O
more O
and O
should O
get O
more O

The O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B

You O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service B
a O
lot O

I O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
portions B
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
especially O
the O
appetizers B
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef O
's O
special O
tasting O
menu B
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer B
1 O
dish B
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
portions B
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
a O
main B
entree I
and O
the O
cold B
udon I
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O

The O
dosas B
are O
skimpy O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn B
topping I
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene B
and O
annoying O
customers B
I O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
Manhattan O

The O
food B
was O
very O
good O
but O
not O
very O
thai O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B
with O
great O
service B
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B

Overall O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
for O
that O
price B
category O

A O
Thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice B
during O
dinner B

Had O
1 O
appetizer B
2 O
entrees B
and O
2 O
cokes B
and O
the O
bill B
was O
~$55.00 O
not O
including O
tip O

The O
chicken B
parm I
was O
edible O
but O
had O
canned O
tomato B
sauce I
and O
boxed O
pasta B
and O
the O
chicken B
with I
portobello I
mushrooms I
consisted O
of O
dry O
inedible O
chicken B
with O
terrible O
sauce B

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
who O
asks O
me O
where O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
meal B

The O
waitresses B
are O
nice O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B
service I
sit O

I O
do O
suggest O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
seated O
upstairs B
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
be O
a O
little O
cozy O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced B
meal B

Their O
pad B
penang I
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O

Their O
bagels B
are O
fine O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
and O
not O
really O
a O
special O
bagel B
experience O

Unlike O
HH O
up O
the O
block O
this O
place O
actually O
gives O
you O
hearty O
and O
hot O
bagels B
this O
town O
is O
known O
for O

The O
barebecued B
salmon I
is O
elegantly O
spiced O
and O
not O
at O
all O
dry O

The O
workers B
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream B
cheese I
gets O
a O
little O
messy O

The O
wine B
the O
service B
was O
very O
good O
too O

His O
wife O
Tanya O
the O
hostess B
completes O
the O
comforting O
atmosphere B
by O
being O
delightfully O
warm O
and O
gracious O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O

You O
do O
n't O
go O
to O
Mizu O
for O
excellent O
service B
you O
go O
for O
the O
large O
amounts O
of O
food B
the O
amiable O
atmosphere B
and O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
feeling O
of O
the O
place O

The O
sushi B
is O
also O
great O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B

The O
staff B
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
they O
're O
fast O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B
and O
fix O
drinks B
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O

The O
food B
is O
inventive O
but O
still O
keeps O
traditional O
indian O
flavoring O

Food B
was O
OK O
fish B
was O
cooked O
well O

And O
the O
bill B
was O
outragous O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel B
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B
beef B
and O
lamb B
dishes I

The O
service B
was O
bad O
the O
food B
took O
to O
forever O
to O
come O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
upper O
level O

We O
a O
menu O
that O
rearely O
changes O
e O
xcept O
for O
one O
or O
two O
specials B
the O
quality B
and O
care B
they O
put O
in O
thier O
food B
in O
evident O

We O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
arrived O
at O
noon O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B

The O
food B
is O
delicious O

The O
bagels B
always O
warm O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O

And O
they O
have O
these O
home O
made O
potato B
chips I
at O
the O
bar B
that O
are O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
in O
the O
world O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality B
cheap O
eats O
this O
is O
the O
place O

Never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
I O
think O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B
and O
in O
quantity B
for O
$ O
3.00 O
in O
NYC O

20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation B
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails B
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B
and O
each O
other O

IT O
IS O
WHAT O
MODERN O
CUISINE B
IS O
ALL O
ABOUT O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B
on O
the O
blackboard O

We O
did O
n't O
get O
drink B
refills I
and O
she O
did O
n't O
even O
offer O
us O
the O
option O
of O
dessert B

in O
an O
effort O
to O
increase O
turnover O
the O
restaurant O
offers O
no O
desserts B
beyond O
the O
complimentary O
espresso B
cup I
filled I
with I
chocolate I
mousse I

Oh O
yes O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
Indian O
oldies O
film O
stars O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
portraits B
of O
Indian O
actors O
and O
actresses O
in O
classic O
black O
white O
that O
adorn O
the O
walls O
some O
of O
which O
I O
would O
love O
to O
know O
where O
they O
obtained O

And O
they O
provided O
a O
delicious O
dessert B
on O
the O
house O

The O
staff B
was O
very O
attentive O
the O
ambience B
lovely O
and O
the O
food B
superb O

The O
waiters B
are O
sweet O
the O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
bill B
is O
never O
too O
large O

We O
ran O
a O
little O
late O
for O
the O
reservation B
but O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
problem O
to O
get O
our O
table B
immediately O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B
and O
seated O
promptly O
The O

I O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B
to O
eat O
it O
just O
is O
not O
THAT O
great O

Oh O
but O
wait O
we O
were O
out O
of O
drinks B
which O
were O
also O
delightfully O
overpriced O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
n't O
great O
and O
the O
desserts B
are O
shipped O
in O
from O
Bruno O
's O
down O
the O
street O
which O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O

great O
wine B
list I
italian O
good O
food B
service B
was O
INITIALLY O
fine O

As O
far O
as O
the O
service B
goes O
the O
waitresses B
were O
not O
particularly O
friendly O
but O
they O
got O
the O
job O
done O

The O
jukebox B
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O

Plus O
they O
made O
a O
perfect O
martini B

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B
was O
great O

This O
place O
has O
realy O
fresh O
sushi B
and O
a O
nice O
large O
menu B
of O
Japanese B
classic I
cuisine I

Turned O
out O
there O
was O
full O
service B
upstairs O
and O
sat O
down O

Several O
of O
the O
dim B
sum I
orders I
had O
about O
6 O
8 O
pieces O

If O
you O
have O
a O
dumpling B
fetish O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
here O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
have O
a O
drink B
and O
conversations O
with O
friends O
go O
to O
sweet O
n O
tart O
and O
order O
yourself O
a O
hong B
kong B
styled I
milk I
and O
tea B
with I
tapioca I
pearls I
hot O

They O
're O
also O
friendlier O
here O
especially O
the O
owner B
Kenny O

While O
the O
room B
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
once O
you O
're O
seated O
you O
'll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what O
's O
on O
your O
plate B

This O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B

The O
kamasutra B
and O
bombay B
cosmopolitan I
are O
excellent O
and O
will O
have O
you O
tipsy O
in O
no O
time O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
good O
food B

Seating B
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there O
's O
alot O
of O
people O

Even O
with O
a O
relatively O
inexpensive O
botle B
of I
wine I
if O
you O
can O
call O
$ O
70.00 O
inexpensive O
the O
cost B
is O
through O
the O
roof O
for O
better O
than O
average O
fare O

They O
have O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O

Get O
the O
tuna B
of O
gari O

Edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices B
given O
what O
s O
in O
the O
area O

The O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O

The O
palak B
paneer I
was O
standard O
and O
I O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
malai B
kofta I

Save O
your O
money O
and O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
calories O
go O
to O
Margharita O
's O
on O
Washington O
Street O
instead O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B
and O
the O
BEST O
service B

They O
sell O
special O
sushi B
everything O
have O
a O
topping B
sauce B
and O
etc O

I O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
there O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O
night O
and O
we O
had O
a O
relaxing O
really O
good O
meal B

All O
the O
desserts B
the O
group O
tried O
got O
favorable O
reviews O

Wonderful O
strawberry B
daiquiries I
as O
well O

The O
sushi B
has O
been O
from O
average O
to O
below O
average O
the O
wait B
service I
has O
always O
been O
sub O
par O
the O
atmosphere B
goes O
from O
nice O
to O
really O
irritating O
if O
you O
sit O
in O
the O
area B
beyond O
the O
kitchen O
the O
acousitcs O
are O
horrid O
everything O
echoes O
is O
extremely O
loud O

I O
would O
recommend O
putting O
your O
name O
down O
and O
then O
getting O
a O
drink B
at O
a O
local O
bar B
first O
though O
because O
of O
the O
wait B
time I

The O
cafe B
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
with O
comfortable O
outdoor B
chairs I
and O
tables B
but O
the O
service B
could O
have O
been O
better O

both O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B
around O
$ O
8 O
for O
dinner B
and O
$ O
5 O
for O
lunch B
and O
are O
delicious O
and O
filling O

The O
portion B
sizes I
here O
are O
huge O
and O
the O
sushi B
is O
good O

Try O
the O
lobster B
teriyaki I
and O
the O
rose B
special I
roll I

The O
food B
was O
delicious O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
relaxed O
and O
we O
have O
now O
adopted O
Plate O
347 O
as O
our O
Secret O
on O
Second O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
're O
ordering O
in O
the O
delivery B
guys I
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O

I O
had O
been O
a O
regular O
due O
to O
the O
consistently O
good O
food B
and O
ease O
of O
getting B
a I
table I

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
like O
Nosh O
as O
much O
as O
I O
did O
but O
the O
pastrami B
on I
challah I
sandwich I
I O
had O
was O
otherworldly O
the O
soups B
are O
like O
Mom O
's O
and O
the O
knishes B
give O
Yonah O
Schimmel O
's O
a O
run O
for O
its O
money O

The O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
and O
the O
prices B
were O
great O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O

The O
prices B
can O
not O
be O
beat O
for O
the O
quality B
quantity B
freshness B
and O
taste B

INCREDIBLY O
POOR O
SERVICE B
AN O
FOOD B
QUALITY I
AT O
EXORBITANT O
PRICES B

I O
have O
been O
about O
4 O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
meal B

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B
is O
this O
friendly O

Very O
good O
wine B
choices I

Just O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B
is O
nasty O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O

The O
pizza B
was O
great O

however O
it O
's O
the O
service B
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O

They O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi B
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B
is O
consistent O

For O
appetizers B
I O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B
fritters I
and O
dumplings B

Such O
nice O
people B
working O
here O
but O
I O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food B

Veal B
Parmigana I
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O

The O
food B
and O
staff B
always O
surprise O
me O
with O
the O
new O
heights O
they O
are O
taken O
to O

Ask O
for O
Usha O
the O
nicest O
bartender B
in O
manhattan O

Deliveries B
often O
take O
up O
to O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
higher O
than O
most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
area O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
for O
my O
friend O
which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O
rice B
and O
keeping O
water B
on O
hand O

Appetizers B
are O
somewhere O
around O
$ O
7 O
each O
and O
the O
main B
dishes I
are O
between O
$ O
11 O
and O
$ O
16 O

I O
was O
n't O
there O
for O
the O
Half B
Price B
Saturday I
Night I
Special I
but O
Tuesday O
Night O

Get O
the O
soup B
and O
a O
nosh B
pastrami I
sandwich I
for O
$ O
8 O
and O
you O
're O
golden O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels B

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar B
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O

We O
shared O
a O
bottle B
of I
sake I
an O
order O
of O
edamames B
and O
she O
had O
the O
sushi B
plate O
while O
I O
had O
the O
sashimi B

From O
the O
appetizers B
we O
ate O
the O
dim B
sum I
and O
other O
variety O
of O
foods B
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
criticize O
the O
food B

We O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
arrived O
at O
noon O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O

Food B
was O
okay O
nothing O
great O

I O
had O
the O
duck B
breast I
special I
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O

The O
food B
is O
very O
average O
the O
Thai B
fusion I
stuff I
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O

Their O
sake B
list I
was O
extensive O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin I
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O

In O
the O
evening O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
with O
it O
NY O
crowd B

The O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B
chai B
and O
the O
chole B
but O
the O
dhosas B
and O
dhal B
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O

The O
kitchen B
however O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O

The O
lava B
cake I
dessert I
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B
in O
the O
neighborhood O

The O
food B
was O
bland O
oily O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B
of I
wine I
while O
we O
waited O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O

The O
waitress B
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B
is O
phenomenal O

Service B
was O
prompt O
friendly O
and O
great O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O

Planet B
Thailand I
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B
which O
is O
great O
the O
thai B
food I
is O
excellent O
too O

Pizza O
the O
only O
pizza B
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
the O
crust B
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
freshly O
baked O
bread O

I O
m O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B
very O
much O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O

Moules B
were O
excellent O
lobster B
ravioli I
was O
VERY O
salty O

Wait B
staff I
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B
on O
the O
UWS O

The O
chicken B
pot I
pie I
is O
excpetiona O
the O
cheeseburger B
huge O
and O
delictable O
and O
the O
service B
professional O
wan O
warm O

Wine B
list I
selection I
is O
good O
and O
wine B
by B
the B
glass B
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B

The O
restaurant B
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B
and I
hyde I
Pub I
last O
night O

The O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B
tortelini I

The O
bagel B
was O
huge O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream O
cheese O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B
santa B
fe I
chopped I
salad I
and O
fish B
and I
chips I

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
for O
their O
food B
the O
ambience B
and O
wonderful O
service B

I O
did O
n't O
complain O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B
so O
much O

Ambience B
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
inexpensive O
sushi B

Big B
Wong I
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment O

They O
have O
it O
all O
great O
price O
food B
and O
service B

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
congee B
noodles B
and O
rice B
dishes I
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O
6 O
each O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B
Salad I
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B
and I
goat I
cheese O
both O
very O
tasty O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B
go O
wrong O
no O
where O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B
pizza I
which O
tasted O
better O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B
beer I
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O

I O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B

Service B
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B
is O
not O
that O
great O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B
and I
noodle I
soup I
dishes I
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O

However O
I O
think O
this O
place B
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O

First O
of O
all O
this O
place B
is O
not O
romantic O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
which O
was O
above O
average O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B

Cute O
place B
nice O
wait B
staff I
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
and O
I O
m O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B
a O
try O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B
with O
great O
service B
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B
England I
Chowder I
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B
Bisque I

The O
portions B
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
excellent O

The O
food B
is O
amazing O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef B
's B
tasting I
menu I
and O
your O
favourite O
bottle O
or O
two O
of O
wine O
from O
an O
extensive O
selection B
of I
wines I

The O
menu B
is O
very O
limited O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O

The O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B

However O
I O
think O
Jeckll B
and I
Hydes I
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O

Service B
was O
quick O

The O
pizza B
was O
great O

The O
owner B
and O
staff B
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B

Try O
green B
curry I
with I
vegetables I

The O
wine B
the O
service B
was O
very O
good O
too O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years O
Emilio(the O
Godfather O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B
and O
wine B
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B
room I

I O
found O
the O
food B
service B
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O

Very O
good O
wine B
choices I

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
NYC O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B
YUM O
and O
a O
family B
style I
salad I

Great O
staff B

Decor B
is O
nice O
though O
service B
can O
be O
spotty O

This O
place B
is O
always O
packed O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B
Bukhara I
Rocks O

The O
dinner B
was O
ok O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O

Not O
a O
great O
place B
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O

Mermaid B
Inn I
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B

The O
service B
is O
good O
and O
ambience B
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O

The O
lobster B
sandwich I
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B
fish I
drunken B
chicken I
and O
the O
soupy B
dumplings I
certainly O
the O
stir B
fry I
blue I
crab I

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
asked O
him O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
maybe O
you O
do O
nt O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B
Noir I
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B

Decor B
is O
charming O

The O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B

Excellent O
atmosphere B
delicious O
dishes B
good O
and O
friendly O
service B

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
food B
drinks B
staff B
mileau B

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B
table I

The O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B
bathroom I
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O

but O
the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O

This O
place B
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
the O
food B

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
and O
the O
spice B
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B
that O
were O
just O
right O

Great O
food B
good O
size O
menu B
great O
service B
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B

I O
m O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O

The O
crust B
is O
thin O
the O
ingredients B
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O

The O
menu B
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
the O
waiter B
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
okay O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B
salmon I
and I
roe I
appetizer I
and I
it O
was O
off O
flavor O

The O
view B
is O
spectacular O
and O
the O
food B
is O
great O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B

Their O
calzones B
are O
horrific O
bad O
vomit O
inducing O
YUCK O

NO O
PIZZA B
33 I
for O
me O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
unheralded O
the O
service B
impecible O
and O
the O
food B
magnificant O

The O
restaurant B
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O

I O
will O
be O

with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
their O
Pizza B

the O
turkey B
burgers I
are O
scary O

The O
sushi B
was O
awful O

Well O
this O
place B
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O

Try O
the O
Pad B
Thai I
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B
menu O
they O
're O
all O
delicious O

The O
brioche B
and I
lollies I
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O

Service B
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O

Its O
location B
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B
again O
and O
again O

noodles B
with I
shrimp I
and I
chicken I
and I
coconut I
juice I
is O
the O
MUST O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B
House I
several O
times O
and O
it O
's O
always O
good O

Terrible O
terrible O
management B
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
down O

delicious O
bagels B
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O

The O
food B
is O
decent O
at O
best O
and O
the O
ambience B
well O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B
the O
service B
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O

The O
waiter B
was O
attentive O

The O
place B
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B
scene I
seems O
to O
be O
happening O

Dessert B
is O
a O
joke O
do O
nt O
bother O

The O
wine B
list I
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B

Fantastic O
place B

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B
for O
meeting O
friends O
having O
lunch O
dinner O
pre O
theatre O
or O
after O
theatre O
drinks O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
drive O
to O
Corona B

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B
which O
is O
exceptional O
is O
the O
service B

Service B
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O

However O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
decor B
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
place O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B

Good O
food B

service B
is O
friendly O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O

Ravioli B
was O
good O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O

Service B
however O
was O
excellent O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting/atmosphere B
a O
lot O

Food B
was O
just O
average O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O

This O
place B
is O
a O
great O
bargain O

Do O
n't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B

The O
best O
pad B
thai I
i O
ve O
ever O
had O

The O
food B
is O
amazing O
rich O
pastas B
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B

Ask O
for O
Usha B
the O
nicest O
bartender O
in O
manhattan O

The O
portions B
are O
HUGE O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
for O
two O
people O

Best O
drumsticks B
over I
rice I
and O
sour B
spicy I
soup I
in O
town O

Indoor B
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O

The O
decor B
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O

The O
portions B
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O

Great O
Indian B
food I
and O
the O
service B
is O
incredible O

The O
owner B
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O

whoever O
the O
jazz B
duo I
was O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O

Was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
instead O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O

The O
food B
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O

Baluchi B
's B
has O
solid O
food B
and O
a O
nice O
decor B
at O
reasonable O
prices O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B
and O
has O
no O
personality O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B

The O
vibe B
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
service B
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
're O
ordering O
in O
the O
delivery B
guys I
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O

We O
were O
4 O
and O
got O
the O
family O
size O
penne B
a I
la I
vodka I
which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
a O
bucket O
of O
food O
literally O

This O
place B
blew O
me O
away O
by O
far O
my O
new O
favorite O
restaurant O
on O
the O
uppereast O
side O

The O
pastas B
are O
incredible O
the O
risottos B
particularly O
the O
sepia B
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B
rabbit I
is O
amazing O

Tasty O
Dog B

But O
the O
best O
pork B
souvlaki I
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B
pizza I
as O
well O
as O
their O
pastas B

Excellent O
food B
although O
the O
interior B
could O
use O
some O
help O

The O
space B
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O

The O
sashimi B
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O

Delivery B
guy I
sometimes O
get O
upset O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tip O
more O
than O
10% O

Best O
Sushi B
Ever O

Place B
is O
open O
till O
late O
no O
dress O
code O

The O
space B
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
1 O
hour O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo B
chinese B
food I

I O
love O
this O
place B

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B
was O
nice O
and O
clean O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
place B
to O
anybody O
even O
for O
a O
casual O
dinner O

the O
food B
is O
always O
fresh O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner B
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O

The O
Seafood B
Dynamite I
is O
also O
otherworldly O

The O
Dancing B
White I
River I
and I
Millenium I
rolls I
are O
musts O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O
REALLY O
LOL O
LOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B
in O
New O
York O

My O
quesadilla B
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three O
year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B

Watch O
the O
talented O
belly B
dancers I
as O
you O
enjoy O
delicious O
baba B
ganoush I
that O
's O
more O
lemony O
than O
smoky O

Pacifico B
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
casually O
hang O
out O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B
in O
New O
York O

Great O
food B
amazing O
service B
this O
place B
is O
a O
class O
act O

I O
ve O
enjoyed O
99% O
of O
the O
dishes B
we O
ve O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too O
authentic O
for O
me O
dish B
I O
m O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O

Service B
was O
wonderful O

Service B
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
filthy O
bathroom B

We O
thought O
the O
dessert B
would O
be O
better O
Wrong O

oh O
speaking O
of O
bathroom O
the O
mens B
bathroom I
was O
disgusting O

The O
boths B
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B
who O
has O
personality O
professionalism O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B
and O
bev B

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings B
and O
i O
mean O
all O

The O
have O
a O
great O
cocktail B
with I
Citrus I
Vodka I
and I
lemon I
and I
lime I
juice I
and I
mint I
leaves I
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O

Food B
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B
2 O
times O
of O
then O

The O
food B
is O
flavorful O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O

The O
atmosphere B
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B
the O
triple B
color I
and I
norwegetan I
rolls I
are O
awesome O
and O
filling O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
to O
for O
modern B
Japanese I
food I
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza B
on O
the O
planet O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B
chinese I
food I

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
because O
the O
place B
is O
pretty O
tiny O

Vanison B
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O

Service B
was O
just O
ok O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
salt B
encrusted I
shrimp I
appetizer I

Food B
was O
amazing O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
ve O
had O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B
tikka I
masala I
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
is O
$ O
25 O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B

But O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B
to O
go O
for O
Indian B
food I

The O
lunch B
buffet I
is O
expensive O
but O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O

Gorgeous O
place B
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B
in O
the O
City O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B
Black I
Cod I
as O
my O
entree O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B
Salmon I
dish I
was O
better O

For O
desserts O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B
black I
sesame I
mousse I
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B
powdered I
green I
tea I
and I
blueberry I
cheesecake I
which O
was O
phenomenal O

I O
do O
n’t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
what O
more O
twice O
but O
I O
’ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O

The O
service B
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O

Great O
Shabu B
Shabu I

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B
Shabu I
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B
walls I
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O

This O
place B
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B
is O
totally O
weird O

The O
food B
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
sitting B
space I
was O
too O
small O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O

Our O
waitress B
was O
n't O
mean O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
the O
manager B
said O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O

The O
manager B
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
the O
drinks B
and O
appetizers B
and O
walked O
out O

cirspy O
crust O
margherita B
pizza I

it O
was O
really O
good O
pizza B

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant B
in O
Manhattan O

Great O
Hot B
Dogs I

The O
hot B
dogs I
are O
top O
notch O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B
is O
amazing O

But O
nonetheless O
great O
spot B
great O
food B

There O
's O
another O
girl B
who O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
with O
brown O
hair O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
really O
talking O
about O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B
special I
which O
was O
perfect O

Here O
the O
hot B
dog I
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B
tacos I
everything O
else O
was O
ok O

Poor O
service B
and O
management B

The O
food B
is O
very O
good O
but O
not O
outstanding O

The O
food B
is O
good O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B
is O
good O
